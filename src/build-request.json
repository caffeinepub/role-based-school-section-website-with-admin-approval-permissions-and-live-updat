      "text": "Add a shiny/animated credit label with the exact text \"Made By Sunyad Ahmed Shrabon\" to the global app footer (in the shared layout) and style it with a subtle “shine” effect that matches the existing school-friendly theme.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The footer displays the exact text \"Made By Sunyad Ahmed Shrabon\" on all pages that render the shared layout/footer.",
        "The credit text has a visible but subtle shine animation (e.g., moving highlight) without harming readability.",
        "The shine animation respects users who prefer reduced motion (when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set, the animation is disabled or replaced with a non-animated style).",
        "No user-facing text is added in any language other than English."
