  "summary": "Diff implements a new shared auth layout + form components and updates RoleSelect/AdminLogin/VisitorLogin/StudentLogin/StudentApply styling with gradients, decorative blobs, improved cards, icons, and micro-animations. Some acceptance criteria items (notably reduced-motion compliance and preserving existing loading behavior on student login/apply) cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Animations respect reduced-motion preferences (no distracting looping motion when prefers-reduced-motion is enabled).",
      "reason": "The diff introduces looping blob animations (\"animation: blobFloat ... infinite\") but the provided/truncated CSS does not show any prefers-reduced-motion override that disables/reduces these animations.",

      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "Existing loading behavior remains correct (e.g., Student login shows spinner when pending; submit buttons disable during pending mutations).",
      "reason": "AuthPrimaryButton supports a loading spinner, but the StudentLoginPage.tsx and StudentApplyPage.tsx diffs are truncated before showing whether the submit button is wired to loginMutation.isPending/submitMutation.isPending via the loading prop and whether the correct disabling behavior is preserved across all forms.",

      "description": "AuthPrimaryButton introduces a hardcoded loading label text \"Loading...\" when loading=true.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks for improved hover/pressed/loading states but does not request changing/loading-copy text; this may alter existing user-facing button text during loading.",
