  "summary": "REQ-18 appears partially implemented: a new `.shine-text` utility with a shine keyframe animation and a `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` override was added in `frontend/src/index.css`, and `AppLayout.tsx` footer was modified (truncated) with indications of a shiny credit. However, due to truncation of `AppLayout.tsx`, the exact required footer text and its application across all shared-layout pages cannot be conclusively verified from the provided diff summary. Additionally, `AppLayout.tsx` shows navigation/routing-related elements that may conflict with the non-goals, but it’s unclear if those were newly introduced in this diff.",
