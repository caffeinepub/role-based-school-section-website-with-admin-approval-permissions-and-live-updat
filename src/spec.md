# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Polish and modernize the UI/UX of all login-related screens across roles to feel more premium and “cool,” while keeping the existing school-friendly blue/white theme and preserving all current functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the visual styling for Role selection, Visitor login, Admin login, Student login, and Student apply pages with a more polished background (e.g., subtle gradient and soft decorative shapes), improved card depth/borders/glow, and cohesive page layout/typography.
- Add smoother, subtle micro-animations for initial load and for hover/focus interactions across cards, buttons, and inputs, while respecting reduced-motion preferences.
- Modernize form inputs and buttons across login/apply pages: consistent spacing, stronger and consistent focus rings, clearer accessible error states (border + helper text), optional leading icons where appropriate, and consistent hover/pressed/disabled/loading states without changing existing loading behavior.
- Refine Role Selection page presentation: improved role card hierarchy and icon tile styling, with smooth hover/focus states that avoid layout shift and keep navigation paths unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Login and role selection screens look more modern and premium, with clearer interactive states and smoother (non-distracting) motion, while all existing login/apply flows and routes behave exactly as before on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
